Installing Memcached
If you run Linux, you can install it using apt-get install memcached or yum install memcached. This will install memcached from a pre-built package but you can alse build memcached from source, "https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Install"

For macOS, using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) is the simplest option. Just run brew install memcached after youâ€™ve installed the Homebrew package manager.

On Windows, you would have to compile memcached yourself or find pre-compiled binaries
(https://commaster.net/posts/installing-memcached-windows/).

Activated memcached after you installed.
